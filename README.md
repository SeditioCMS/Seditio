<h2>Seditio</h2>

Seditio is a modular content management system and content management framework powered by PHP and MySQL.

The engine distinguishes itself from other content management systems by keeping the HTML code completely separate from the PHP. 
This allows graphic designers to create skins without having to know much PHP. Seditio can be skinned by editing pre-made skins 
supplied by the community, or easily making one's own by creating a template, and simply substituting for the TPL tags.
